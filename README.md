# ConnMan
A Qt6-based graphical interface for managing remote file systems, which can be attached to the file system as a local folder. The program is one of the own developments of the blackPanther Project, but it is still in the testing phase, this is the first public version... We have already built in support for several file systems, but if you want something that is not yet included, feel free to write to the project's email address and we will incorporate it.

Remote storages mount to local filesystem with user rights via:
* [fuse](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse)
* Gio for other method, ex: Samba
* OAuth for Google Drive
* etc

The operation is extremely simple. Add a connection with the add button, enter the address and login information (if any), save it, and simply click the connect button. The program saves the connections to an SQLite3 database.
